 * MySQL Exercise 1:
 *
 *      Using MySQLWorkbench,
 *
 *      1.) If you haven't already, create the college database as instructed here:
 *              https://platform.codingnomads.co/learn/mod/page/view.php?id=2133
 *      2.) Create a new table "students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. age
 *
 *      3.) Create a new table "teachers_students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. student_id
 *          c. teacher_id
 *
 *      4.) Create a new table "teachers" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. last_name
 *          d. subject
 *
 *      5.) Create the appropriate foreign key constraints in the "teachers_students" table.
 *
 *      6.) Populate each table with at least 5 records. Use the "teachers_students" to associate various
 *          teachers with various students.
 *
 *      7.) Write queries (and paste them below) for each of the following tasks:
 *          a. select all students
            SELECT * FROM university.students;

 *          b. select all teacher who teach "Math" (choose a subject you included)
            SELECT * FROM university.teachers WHERE subject = "Math";

 *          c. use a join query to select all students with a certain teacher
            SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name
            FROM university.students s
            JOIN university.teacher_student ts on s.id = ts.studentID
            JOIN university.teachers t on ts.teacherID = t.id
            WHERE t.first_name = 'Phil'

 *          d. use a join query to select all students with taking a certain subject
            SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name
            FROM university.students s
            JOIN university.students_courses sc on s.id = sc.student_id
            JOIN university.courses c on sc.course_id = c.id
            WHERE c.name = 'design'

 *          e. update a record in the student table
            UPDATE university.students
            SET first_name = 'Roy', last_name = 'Gino'
            WHERE id = 5;

 *          f. add a record to the teacher table
            INSERT university.teachers (id, first_name, last_name, subject)
            VALUES (6, 'Mary', 'Tanya', 'Chemistry');
 *
 *       8.) Export the schema to a dump file and copy it to this folder.
