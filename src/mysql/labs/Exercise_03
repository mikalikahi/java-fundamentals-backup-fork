*  MySQL Exercise 3:
*
*   Now that you have your air travel database all set up and populated, please demonstrate how to:
*
*       1.) Query all flights on a specific day
        SELECT flights.idflights, flights.departure_time, flights.arrival_time
        FROM air_travel.flights
        WHERE flights.departure_time LIKE '2022-11-20%';

*       2.) Query all flights between two specific cities on a specific day
        SELECT flights.idflights, flights.departure_time, flights.arrival_time
        FROM air_travel.flights
        WHERE flights.departure_time LIKE '2022-11-20%'
        AND flights.departure_location_id = 2
        AND flights.arrival_location_id = 5;

*       3.) Query all passengers on a specific flight between two specific cities today
        SELECT p.idpassengers, p.given_name, p.surname
        FROM air_travel.passengers p
        JOIN air_travel.tickets t ON t.passenger_id = p.idpassengers
        JOIN air_travel.flights f ON f.idflights = t.flight_id
        WHERE f.departure_time LIKE '2022-11-20%'
        AND f.departure_location_id = 2
        AND f.arrival_location_id = 5;

*       4.) Query the flight information for a specific passenger on a specific flight
        SELECT p.idpassengers, p.given_name, p.surname
        FROM air_travel.passengers p
        JOIN air_travel.tickets t ON t.passenger_id = p.idpassengers
        JOIN air_travel.flights f ON f.idflights = t.flight_id
        WHERE f.idflights = 2;

*       5.) Query the passenger information for a specific user on a specific flight yesterday
        SELECT p.idpassengers, p.given_name, p.surname
        FROM air_travel.passengers p
        JOIN air_travel.tickets t ON t.passenger_id = p.idpassengers
        JOIN air_travel.flights f ON f.idflights = t.flight_id
        WHERE f.departure_time LIKE CONCAT(SUBSTRING(SUBDATE(NOW(),1), 1, 10), '%');

*       6.) Query the number of flights between two specific cities this week, month, and year
        SELECT p.idpassengers, p.given_name, p.surname
        FROM air_travel.passengers p
        JOIN air_travel.tickets t ON t.passenger_id = p.idpassengers
        JOIN air_travel.flights f ON f.idflights = t.flight_id
        WHERE f.departure_time LIKE CONCAT(SUBSTRING(SUBDATE(NOW(),1), 1, 10), '%');

*       7.) Query the number of passengers that travelled between two specific cities today, this week, month and year
*       8.) Insert records for new flights between airports

*       9.) Insert records for new tickets and passengers on specific flights
        INSERT INTO `air_travel`.`tickets` (`idtickets`, `flight_id`, `passenger_id`, `price`) VALUES ('3', '2', '3', '1000.00');
*       10.) Update meal preference (or something similar) for a specific passenger on a specific flight
*       Bonus: Have some fun - get creative - what else can you do? Flex those SQL muscles and show us what
*           you've got! :)
